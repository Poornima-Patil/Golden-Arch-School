<p><strong>NEWS LETTER JULY 15</strong><br />
Come July and we were waiting to  travel with the children. You guessed it right!!! This month’s theme was  Transport.<br />
<strong>Theme for the Month: TRANSPORT</strong><br />
<br />
After 2 months of travel and  vacation we felt it is apt to start the month with Transport. We took the  children on a journey from the invention of wheel to the experience of flying  in an aero plane. The most exciting journey of the month was the field trip to  the <strong><em>Car  Showroom</em></strong> and <strong><em>Automobile workshop</em></strong>. Guess parents  would have heard their tiny tots discussing about cars, car washing and  repairs. The <strong><em>experience</em></strong> of going out with their friends and learning is an  important aspect of the Montessori system. On the Theme culmination day the elementary  Children refreshed the concepts learnt for the Pre Primary children through  their skit.<br />
<br />
Since the kids were always  looking forward to go to school, the parents were inquisitive to know what  happens at the school. We had a <strong><em>‘Parent as the child’</em></strong> workshop,  where Parents came to school just like their children and experienced the  Montessori material. 
<p>Towards the end of July children celebrated Guru  Poornima in honor of their gurus or teachers. It was a sight to see the  children dressed as various Gurus and speak a few words about them. Not to  mention the children enjoyed delicious sweets after their presentations and  went home with sweet memories. </p>

<p><strong>Newsletter – June 2015  </strong><br />
  We welcomed the New Year with lot  of energy and bigger space in our environments. It was a pleasure to see the  tiny tots walking to their environments wearing a big smile. We had an  Orientation program for new parents to welcome them into the Golden Arch family.  This was to acquaint them to the Montessori system and the profound spirit with  which Golden Arch works. <br />
  Complete emphasis for this month  was to settle our fresher’s. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Theme for the Month: Panchatantra</strong><br />
  What better way to start a year by reliving all the  grandma’s stories. With the children’s memories filled with the vacation spent  with their grandparents it felt homely to talk about Panchatantra stories.

<p>While the Pre Montessori children  were busy learning how to fold and unfold their mats and carry them, the Pre-Primary  were busy working on phonetic analysis and Pink Tower and the Elementary  children were engrossed learning the concept of square root, fractions, Noun  and Mesopotamian civilization.  <br />
  <br />
Highlight of the month was the Father’s  day when children expressing their love for their dads by hand printing on  their dad’s t-shirts.  <br />
Thus began our journey for the  academic year 15-16.<br />
<br />
Parents can look forward to many  more such activities which are in store for their children.<br />

This was to  acknowledge them of the Montessori system and the profound spirit with which  golden arch works. Hence we all embarked on to the journey together for the  sake of our children.<br />
          <br />
        Complete emphasis for this month was to settle our freshers.  Hence activities are planned at a minimum. <br />
            <em>Theme for the month -  Environment</em><br />
            <br />
        The month started with awareness about “Environment -  a great beginning with a noble cause”.  <br />
            <br />
        Our Archies sowed ragi seeds in the form of the  beginning  letter of their name . With  the seeds they sowed, we have also sowed in them a sense of responsibility to  love and protect the environment.<br />
            <br />
        They learnt to save nature with various other activities . </p>

        September  seemingly an interesting month for the teachers as all the prominence is given  on ‘Teachers day’. Overflowing  with  wishes and flowers spotted with cute little mementos of gratitude is the 5th  of September. Most important milestone every year at Golden Arch is the <strong>‘Teachers Day out’</strong> filled with Training  , Team building activities and loads of fun. This brings back and revitalizes  every teacher to take on the next half of the academic year with fresh spirit  of teaching and love for children.<br />
        <br />
        One day  outing this time was at the Guhantara resort .<br />
        <br />
        Something  that one cannot survive without . The basic thing we would wake up needing  and sleep –WATER ! was the theme of the  month. The teachers used different modes to bring out the concept of water.<br />
        <br />
        There was an  AV session. Activities using water- WATER Day ! Cooking, making juices..  cleaning the classroom etc were carried out.<br />
        <br />
        The primary  children understood the concept of WATER CYCLE and presented a skit before all  the school children.<br />
        <br />
        Ganesh  chaturthi celebration went on as a ritual at school and children were involved  in the bhajans .They could repeat the versus with so much precision as it would  be heard from a recorder.</p>

        The level  3  and Primary children were busy  consolidating their lessons during the last week.<br />
      </p>
      <p><span class="style1"><strong>August</strong></span><br />
        <strong>Theme of the month – Sports!</strong></p>
        <p>During the  wet monsoons, cloudy skies and gloomy days, Golden Arch was still bright,  gleaming with activities.<br />
          <br />
          As the cold  and wet days passed, to treat the lazy bones ‘Sports’ was our theme for the  month. An introduction to the games world was given to them with demonstrations  of various sports. Outdoor and Indoor sports was well absorbed by the children.  An Audio visual of sportsmen and various kinds of games was shown.<br />
          <br />
          An outdoor  activity for casual sports as planned was not permitted by our unpredictable  rains, hence children enjoyed the activity indoors. It was superb fun – as said  by one of the child. Cheering each other with hurdle races, balancing the bean  bags, parachute and so on </p>

          <strong>Celebrations –</strong><br />
          <strong>Independence day  - 15.08.2013</strong> <br />
          could see a stream of our freedom fighters  declaring their vow to fight for the freedom. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Krishna Janmashtami – 28.08.2013</strong><br />
          witnessed a  Ayodhya at school with the butter pots hanging and the krishnas of golden arch  trying to reach it. Though they could not find butter in the pots, every child  got their lovable butter packet. There was a Radha with a pot full of butter,  but she refused to offer it to Krishna. What an Irony!! Krishna’s natkat  stories enthralled the children, they must’ve felt relieved about their  naughtiness J.</p>
        <p><strong>Best out of waste</strong><br />
          Primary  children were at a task during this month. They were to make a best thing out  of the waste. How  innovative and creative. Children carried the junk from home to create  different things like the Robot out of the empty boxes. A picture frame out of  the waste CD’s. An engine piggy box out of the paint boxes. A wall hanging out  of the pista shells/ice cream sticks<br />
          <br />

        Field trip:</strong><br />
      The pre-  primary children were taken on a field trip to visit some of our  ‘our helpers’, to learn how each of them  contribute through their work for the benefit of the larger society, and to  understand how each of their roles, irrespective of how meager it may be, is  essential for the society and thus, all of them must be respected. Children of  different age groups were taken to the tailor, cobbler, dentist and the banker  respectively, observing their profession keenly, giving us an intuition that  one day, our Golden Archies will be a responsible contributor to the society as  well.
      <p><strong>School visit by Helpers</strong><br />
        We also had  a carpenter and a plumber who visited the school, to the great excitement of  the children. They showed the children little tricks with their tools and  explained them the simple mechanisms involved in their work.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>School trip: for the Senior Archies!  (1-4 graders)</strong><br />
        The primary  children were taken on a trip to the Vishweswaraiah Technological museum. The  place proved to be more than just a scientific learning experience for them.  They trotted among the various scientific models, looking at the scientific  phenomenon with utmost curiosity, and asking innocent questions every now and  then,  reminding us that the child’s mind  is a huge ocean of thoughts, each drop filled with boundless curiosity. Though the whole time was a fun filled, lovely experience, the dinosaurs  and the 3D show were voted as the favorite by   children.  <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Parent workshop: Parent as the Child</strong><br />
        The parent  workshop was conducted, to act as an interface between the parent and the  Montessori environment. As the Montessori system of education is new, and  slowly gaining acceptance, not many parents are well aware about the system.  Hence, this workshop helped to enhance their understanding about the same. We  also believe it is vital for the parents to know how the child is taught, so  that the parent and the school can work together, and mutually contribute to  the child’s growth. All the parents who took part are well appreciated. <strong><br />
          <br />
        Thank you for Parents who could make it,  For those who could not! You have missed it! Make sure to meet us next time. </strong></p></td></tr>
